# Storybook Addon for AngularJS

This addon also supports the new MDX format, which is nice to write documentation about your components.

You can write the stories right here in the Markdown file with a simple template

<Preview>
  <Story name="Simple Template" height="120px">
    {`
      <quote-card author="'Me'">
        It works with a simple template!
      </quote-card>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

You can also provide the template and its properties

<Preview>
  <Story name="Template and Props" height="120px">
    {{
      template: `
        <quote-card author="author">
          {{content}}
        </quote-card>
      `,
      props: {
        content: "It works with template and props!",
        author: "Me",
      },
    }}
  </Story>
</Preview>
