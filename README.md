> **Note**
> This addon is intended to be used with `@storybook/html` or `@storybook/web-components`, available since Storybook 4.

## Installation

Use your favorite ðŸ“¦ package manager to install the addon in your project's `devDependencies`:

**npm:**

```sh
npm install --save-dev storybook-addon-angularjs
```

**Yarn:**

```sh
yarn add --dev storybook-addon-angularjs
```

## Usage

### Usage with @storybook/html

This addon is flexible enough to let you choose how you want to write stories.

Your stories can be as simple as this:

```js
export default {
  title: "QuoteCard",
  decorators: [withAngularJs("myApp")],
};

export const simpleTemplate = () => `
  <quote-card author="'Me'">
    It works with a simple template!
  </quote-card>
`;
```

But you may choose something more advanced:

```js
import { withKnobs, text } from "@storybook/addon-knobs";
import { action } from "@storybook/addon-actions";

import { html, withAngularJs } from "storybook-addon-angularjs";

class MockedAppService {
  constructor() {
    this.message = "Mocked message";
  }
}

function mockLoggingService($log) {
  return {
    log: function(message) {
      $log.log(message);
    },
  }
}

export default {
  title: "QuoteCard",
  decorators: [withKnobs, withAngularJs /* OR */ withAngularJs("myApp")],
  parameters: {
    ng: {
      module: "myApp", // optional when provided in the decorator
      rebuild: undefined, // optional, indicates when to rebuild the story. Can be "always", "mount" (when switching stories) or "update" (when updating knobs or controls)
      hooks: {
        beforeCompile() {
          // called once before compiling the the component
        },
        beforeUpdate(SomeService) {
          // called before updating the component with new props
          SomeService.setValue("Hi!");
        },
      },
      mock: {
        // When the app depends on modules which cannot be provided in the story you can mock them
        modules: ["some.external.module"],
        // You can mock / override constants here
        constants: {
          API_URL: "https://example.com",
        },
        // You can mock / override services here (dependency injection also works)
        services: {
          AppService: MockedAppService,
        },
        // You can mock / override factories here (dependency injection also works)
        factories: {
          LoggingService: mockLoggingService,
        },
      }
    },
  },
};

export const fancyTemplate = () => {
  const content = text("Content", "It works with a fancy tagged template string!");
  const author = text("Author", "Me");
  const onEvt = action("clicked");

  return html`
    <quote-card author="${author}" on-click="${onEvt}(foo)">
      {{${content}}}
    </quote-card>
  `;
};
```

You can even write stories with Markdown files, with the support for the [MDX Story Format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/mdx-syntax/). This is awesome for writing documentation for your components.

```md
import { Meta, Story, Preview } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";

import { withAngularJs } from "storybook-addon-angularjs";

<Meta title="Demos|MDX Demos" decorators={[withAngularJs("myApp")]} />

# Storybook Addon for AngularJS

This is a simple Quote Card:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Simple Template" height="120px">
    {`
      <quote-card author="'Me'">
        It works with a simple template!
      </quote-card>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>
```

See these and more examples in the [example subfolder](./example).

### Usage with @storybook/web-components

You can use this addon using `web-components` instead of raw `html`. As [angularJS is fully compliant with the web components spec](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/), we can build our components as if they were native ones! This allows you to use all of their tooling but, from a storybook POV, we can get auto-generated controls if you define `custom-elements.json`!

```js
import { wc, withAngularJs } from "storybook-addon-angularjs";

const component = "quote-card";

export default {
  title: "QuoteCard",
  decorators: [withAngularJs("myApp")],
  component,
};

const Template = (args) => {
  return wc(component, args);
};

export const NoDefaults = Template.bind({});
export const Large = Template.bind({});

Large.args = {
  size: "large",
};
```

See these and more examples in the [example subfolder](./exampleWC).

#### Known issues

- Slots are not working
- Autogenerated ArgTypes can be a bit finnicky (e.g.: instead of a combo box for a fix set of choices, you'll need to fill your input wrapped with "")

## API
